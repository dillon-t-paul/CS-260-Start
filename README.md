# CS-260-Start
My first CS Repository for CS 260
I'm from North Carolina, but I have lived in a number of different states. I enjoy activities like running and lifting weights, as well as learning about various interests. Some of my favorite things to learn about are computers and their hardware, as well as working on cars and construction. At this point, I'm nearing my junior and have enjoyed learning about computers and how they work when it comes to coding.
